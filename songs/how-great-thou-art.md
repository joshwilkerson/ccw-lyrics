# How Great Thou Art

**Verse 1**
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

**Chorus**
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

**Verse 2**
When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

**Chorus**
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
