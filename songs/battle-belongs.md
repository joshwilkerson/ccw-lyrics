# Battle Belongs

### Verse 1

When all I see is the battle, you see my victory
When all I see is the mountain, you see a mountain moved
And as I walk through the shadow, your love surrounds me
There’s nothing to fear now, for I am safe with You

### Chorus

So when I fight, I’ll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I’ll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You

### Verse 2

And if You are for me, who can be against me?
For Jesus there’s nothing impossible for You
When all I see are the ashes, You see the beauty
When all I see is a cross, God You see the empty tomb

### Bridge

Almighty Fortress, You go before us
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
You shine in the shadow, You win every battle
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
