# Rest On Us

### Verse 1

As the Spirit was moving over the waters
Spirit, come move over us
Come rest on us
Come rest on us

### Chorus

Come down Spirit, when You move You make my heart pound
When You fill the room
You're here and I know You are moving
I'm here and I know You will fill me

### Verse 2

Fire and wind, come and do it again
Open up the gates, let Heaven on in (come)
Come rest on us
Come rest on us

### Bridge

Holy Spirit come rest on us
You're all we want
You're all we want
