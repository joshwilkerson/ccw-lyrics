# Trust in God

### Verse 1

Blessed Assurance, Jesus is mine
He's been my fourth man in the fire, time after time
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood
And what He did for me on Calvary is more than enough

### Chorus (x2)

I trust in God, my Savior
The one who will never fail
He will never fail

### Verse 2

Perfect submission, all is at rest
I know the author of tomorrow has ordered my steps
So this is my story and this is my song
I'm praising my risen King and Savior all the day long

### Chorus (x2)

I trust in God, my Savior
The one who will never fail
He will never fail

### Bridge (x4)

I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
That's why I trust Him, that's why I trust Him

### Chorus (x2)

I trust in God, my Savior
The one who will never fail
He will never fail

### Bridge (x2)

I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
That's why I trust Him, that's why I trust Him

### Chorus (x2)

I trust in God, my Savior
The one who will never fail
He will never fail
