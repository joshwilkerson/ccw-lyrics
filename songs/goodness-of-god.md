# Goodness of God

### Verse 1

I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

### Chorus

'Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

### Verse 2

I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In darkest night
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God

### Chorus (x2)

'Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

### Bridge (x2)

Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me

### Chorus (x2)

And all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
