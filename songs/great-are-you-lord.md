# Great Are You Lord

### Verse

You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness
You give hope, You restore every heart that is broken
And great are You, Lord

### Chorus

It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise, we pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise to You only

### Bridge

All the earth will shout Your praise
Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing
Great are You, Lord
