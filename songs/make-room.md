Here is where I lay it down
Every burden, every crown
This is my surrender
This is my surrender

And I will make room for You
To do whatever You want to
To do whatever You want to

Shake up the ground of all my tradition
Break down the walls of all my religion
Your way is better
Oh Your way is better

Here is where I lay it down
You are all I'm chasing now
