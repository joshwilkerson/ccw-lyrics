# Praise Yahweh

### Verse 1

King of kings and Lord of all
Behold the Lamb upon the throne
Before You every crown will fall
Jesus Christ, You stand alone

### Chorus

Halle, halle-lujah All the praise is Yours
Halle, halle-lujah Our song forevermore
Sing, Holy, holy Holy is the Lord
Halle, halle-lujah All the praise is Yours

### Verse 2

Day and night, it never stops
That ancient and eternal song
Heaven and earth will sing as one
To the One who was and is to come
The One who was and is to come

Praise Yahweh Praise Yahweh
Praise Your name Now and forever
